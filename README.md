# Dotfiles repository
This repo is meant to set-up a new system with your familiar settings for your terminal.

## Before all
It is necessary to create a GitHub personal access token (PAT). Log into GitHub and go to 

`Settings -> Developer Settings ->  Personal access tokens`

Create a new token and give it ONLY the rights to write/read public keys and make the expiration date as small as possible! **Copy the key for the next step.**

## Initial commands
Download and run the `pre-install.sh` file first. This will install Git and clone the dotfiles repo.

## Install
Now run `install.sh`.
